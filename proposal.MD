**Advertisement Proposal**

I plan to create a soundscape that goes hand in hand with my visual argument, an advertisement of sorts.
I intend for it to sound like a commercial or a podcast of someone visiting a trade school and a normal school.

Assets:
* Machinery whirring
* Students chatting in lecture hall before class
